# Summary: Contributor Issue Resolution

## Good News! 🎉

Your repository is **completely clean**. No code changes or git history modifications are needed.

## What We Found

After analyzing all 115 commits in your repository:
- ✅ Every commit uses only your RP1999 email: `163238777+RP1999@users.noreply.github.com`
- ✅ Your `.mailmap` file is correctly configured
- ✅ No commits were made by `Ranidu1999` or `chala-nii` accounts

## The Real Problem

GitHub shows contributors based on **GitHub account email associations**, not just git commits.

The emails in your `.mailmap`:
- `hansikachalani875@gmail.com` (possibly linked to `chala-nii`)
- `it22925572@my.sliit.lk` (possibly linked to `Ranidu1999`)
- `promoranidu@gmail.com` (possibly linked to `Ranidu1999`)

If these emails are linked to those GitHub accounts, GitHub will show them as contributors **even though they made no commits**.
